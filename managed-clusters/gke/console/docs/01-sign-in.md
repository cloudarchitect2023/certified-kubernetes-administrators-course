Since this is a Google product, it will work best in Chrome browser. Other mainstream browsers *should* be fine.

Note that if you are already signed into your browser with a Google account, it may try to use that and you will get an error. If you already have a personal GCP account, then it *will* use this! If either of these happen, close the browser tab and use an incognito window to sign into the playground account.
