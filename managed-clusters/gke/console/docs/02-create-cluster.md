# Creating the Cluster

There is no longer any need to select project, or set up routes or firewall rules as directed by the [original guide published on the Community Forum](https://kodekloud.com/community/t/playground-series-how-to-create-a-managed-kubernetes-cluster-with-google-kubernetes-engine/230314). These are now all in place when you start, therefore you can get straight onto configuring the cluster.

1. In the menu on the left, select `Kubernetes Engine`. You don't need to select any item from the submenu that pops up.
1. On the following screen, press the `CREATE CLUSTER` button. You will arrive at the Cluster Basics screen.
1. Near the top right of this screen, click on `SWITCH TO STANDARD CLUSTER`, and confirm this is what you want to do in the dialog that pops up
1. Edit the cluster name as shown below. Other names *should* be ok, but if you have issues, use this one. Leave all other fields as defaults<br/><br/> ![basics](../images/02-cluster-basics.png)
